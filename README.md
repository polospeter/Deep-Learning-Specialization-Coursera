# Deep Learning Specialization

This repository contains all my solutions for the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera provided by DeepLearning.ai. The instructor of this specialization was the brilliant Andrew Ng.

**My Certification** : https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/KF38BTHQF8QJ

### Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this class, you will:
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 

This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. If you are looking for a job in AI, after this course you will also be able to answer basic interview questions.
